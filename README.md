I'm a former U.S. Army Infantry Team Leader and international security professional who made the leap into software engineering. After years of leading operations under pressure — from military deployments to securing critical infrastructure overseas — I discovered a new mission: building clean, functional, and impactful software.

I recently completed General Assembly’s Software Engineering Immersive, where I trained in full-stack web development and built real-world applications using modern technologies. I’m passionate about solving problems, learning fast, and writing code that’s reliable, readable, and ready for scale.
